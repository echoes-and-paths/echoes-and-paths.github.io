It's fitting that this journey begins in the quiet hours, when thoughts tend to echo the loudest. As Echo Noctis, I've created this space not knowing exactly where it will lead, but knowing that the best paths are often discovered rather than planned.

There's something about putting thoughts into words that makes them more real, more tangible. Perhaps that's why we write - not just to remember, but to understand.

No categories, no rigid structure, no predetermined destination. Just honest reflections, captured in the moments they surface.

Welcome to echoes and paths.
