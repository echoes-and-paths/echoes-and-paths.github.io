# Living Rent-Free

They showed up like they own the place,  
shadow in the doorway, no bag, no knock,  
just slid right in, like they had a right,  
like they'd been here before,  
settling in like dust on an old couch.

First, I thought, *they’ll leave soon, just passing through,*  
but nope, they unpacked, took up space,  
made themselves at home.  
Pushed my peace right off the shelf,  
set their baggage right where it don’t belong.

I tried everything—  
locked doors, loud arguments, silence,  
even looked the other way,  
but they have tricks, slide back in,  
soft as smoke, sneaky like shadows.

They leave clutter everywhere,  
stack up doubt like dishes I haven't cleaned,  
hangin’ up old hurt on every wall,  
crowding my thoughts, messig up my head,  
and I’m just… tired.

And when I say, “Look, you've gotta go,”  
they just lean back, smirk on their face,  
“C’mon now, you’d miss me,”  
like they know I’m caught,  
like they know I can’t shake them.

So here we sit, me and them,  
roommates in a lease I never signed,  
them living rent-free, and me…  
just tryna find space that’s mine.
