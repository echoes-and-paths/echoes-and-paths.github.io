# My Dearest Love,

Permit me, if you will, to unburden my soul through these humble lines, for words are all that remain to me when my arms dare not reach for you, when my lips, once so familiar with yours, now tremble with longing and hesitation. I find myself a man torn asunder, grappling with an emptiness that consumes me as a relentless tide overtakes the shore. And yet, I know not how to still the tempest within, save by laying bare my heart to you, as I have ever done.

You speak of love that remains, yet slips through the quiet spaces between us, a ghost of what was once fervent and whole. I do not doubt your words, nor do I question your truth—for I have seen the storm that troubles your spirit, and would that I could bear its weight for you. I have stepped aside, as you sought space to find yourself amidst the questions that haunt you. But, my dearest, in doing so, I have found myself adrift, a vessel without its anchor, longing for the warmth of a touch that now evades me.

What cruel paradox is this—that love should endure in the mind and yet falter in the flesh? Our bed lies cold, a void that speaks louder than words ever could. The absence of your embrace is a wound deeper than any blade could inflict, and each night I lie awake, hand outstretched toward where you rest, yearning for the spark that once ignited our world to return. Yet I hold back, fearful that my longing might be a weight upon you, when all I wish is for you to breathe freely, to find peace within yourself.

I write not to implore, nor to demand what you cannot give. No, my love, I seek only to be known—to share with you the hollow that echoes within me, so you might glimpse the man who loves you still with every fractured piece of his heart. I ask for no promises beyond honesty, no touch beyond what you can offer without burden. Yet, should there ever be a flicker of that flame we once kindled together, know that I stand ready to meet it with open arms, with lips that ache to whisper, *"I love you"* once more into the hush between us.

Your happiness remains my compass, even as it leads me through shadows. Should your path diverge from mine, I would not hold you back. But oh, if there is a road where we might walk together again, hand in hand, I would tread it with you until my final breath.

**Forever yours, in longing and love,**  
*Your Devoted Husband*
